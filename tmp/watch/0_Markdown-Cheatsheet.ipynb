"Code blocks are part of the Markdown spec, but syntax highlighting isn\u0027t. However, many renderers -- like Github\u0027s and *FSharp.Formatting* -- support syntax highlighting. Which languages are supported and how those language names should be written will vary from renderer to renderer. \n",
